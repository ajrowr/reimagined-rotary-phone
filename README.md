Some tools I made to make my coding life easier in a networked world.

Strappy: a basic set of useful things for Javascript. Most notably, Python-like string formatting.

Lmod: a module loader for shells. Lets you stash functionality you want in different places, in "modules" stored here on Github.

Listdir: Apache's directory lister is horrible and alternatives are scarce. Here's a work-in-progress one which uses a Python CGI and Apache config fragment. Currently best used as an example of how to build your own.

### Note: I'm still migrating this over from gist.github.com so there may be some quirks.
